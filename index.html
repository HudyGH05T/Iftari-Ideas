      Good Morning Ladies And Gentlemen Above We can See A Blessing In Disguise,
      BIRYANI a wonderful dish that brings the family together, rated 10/10 by
      Haris Reviews
    </p>
    <p>
      But Haris how do I make biryani at home? Dont worry I got u covered my
      freind Step 1: Prepare the chicken curry. Prepare the biryani masala (or
      use store-bought) and marinate the chicken. Cook the chicken curry. While
      it's cooking over low heat, prepare the rice. Step 2: Parboil the rice.
      Bring a pot of water to a boil and parboil the rice. Drain and set aside.
      Layer half of the rice, all of the chicken, and then the remaining rice on
      top. Add the finishing touches. Allow steam to develop, then lower the
      heat and let the flavors meld NOW FOR THE MOST FLAVOUR THE... BIRYANI
      MASALA Pakistani biryani is heavy on spice (and flavor!), and is often
      made with biryani masala, or simply put, a medley of spices that come
      together to give it a distinct, masaledar (or spice-laden) taste. I
      recommend you use the biryani masala recipe below (all you need is a good
      spice grinder and a few extra whole spices). If you’d prefer not to, you
      can substitute your favorite store-bought biryani masala. This recipe has
      been tested and works great with Bombay Biryani Masala. To make Biryani
      masala for this recipe, combine the following ingredients in a spice
      grinder and process until mostly smooth. Makes ~2 tbsp, which is the exact
      quantity you’ll need for this recipe. 1 medium dried bay leaf (tez patta)
      2 dried button red chili peppers (sukhi lal mirch) 1 small whole mace
      (javetri) 1 2-inch cinnamon stick (daarchini) 4-5 whole cloves (loung) 1
      black cardamom (badi elaichi) 1 star anise (baadiyan) 3-4 green cardamom
      pods (elaichi) 1 tsp roasted cumin seeds or black cumin seeds (shahzeera)
      1/2 tsp black peppercorns (kaali mirch) 1/4 tsp fennel (saunf) 1/4 tsp
      carom seeds (ajwain)

      HOW TO MAKE THE CHICKEN TENDER AND FLAVORFUL There are 3 components that
      make the chicken tender and deeply flavored: Marinate the chicken in
      spices and yogurt. This infuses the chicken with noticeable flavor.
      Ideally, marinate overnight or for at least a couple hours, but I tested
      and found that it’s still very tasty if you marinate just before making
      the biryani. Take the chicken out of the fridge before you start preparing
      the biryani. Allowing the chicken to come closer to room temperature helps
      it cook more evenly and stay tender. Lastly, after sautéing the chicken in
      the hot oil, add water and allow the chicken to simmer gently, covered,
      over low heat.

      HOW TO PARBOIL THE RICE TO ENSURE FLUFFY RICE IN BIRYANI Identifying
      doneness can be confusing, so I’ve simplified it by giving time parameters
      to take the guesswork out of boiling. If you’re using the recommended
      aged, long-grain basmati rice, you’ll need to boil for 5 minutes. If
      you’re using newly harvested basmati rice often found in American grocery
      stores, it’ll require a shorter boiling time (around 4 minutes).
      Ingredients for preparing the parboiled rice for chicken biryani - raw
      rice, oil, and salt For reference, here’s how my rice acts
      minute-to-minute: At 3 minutes, the rice still has a raw center. At 4
      minutes, the center has mostly cooked, but the rice kernel is still tough.
      Around 5 minutes, the rice starts to swell and the rice is just-cooked. In
      between 5 minutes and 5:30 seconds is when it’s ideal to stop boiling the
      rice. At 6 minutes, the rice is cooked, but starts to break easily without
      getting mushy. In between 7-8 minutes, the rice gets mushy once pressed
      between your fingers. This is a sign that it’s overcooked and is more
      likely to break during the ‘dum’ stage. Tip: Drain the rice promptly so
      the hot water doesn’t continue cooking the rice. Also note that a little
      overcooked or undercooked rice is not going to ruin your biryani
